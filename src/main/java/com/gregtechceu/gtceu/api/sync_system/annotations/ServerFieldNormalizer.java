/**
 * Marks a method that validates and canonicalizes a decoded client candidate before a bidirectionally synced field is
 * changed.

 * <p>
 * The method must be a non-static member of the class that declares the target fields. It must accept exactly one
 * parameter and return exactly the target field type; all named fields must share that type. The targets must use
 * {@link SyncBoth}, so the server can always acknowledge the authoritative canonical value. The method must be a pure
 * function and must not modify its holder or any external state. Throwing an exception rejects the complete
 * field-update batch.
